Reflection:
Using unique constraints and foreign keys significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of a database.
Unique constraints prevent duplicate entries, ensuring that each record is distinct, while foreign keys maintain referential integrity by linking related tables and preventing orphaned records.

These features simplify data retrieval by allowing intuitive queries and streamline data management by automating updates and deletions of related records. 
Overall, they create a coherent structure that reduces errors, ensures consistency, and facilitates better decision-making, making the database more robust and user-friendly.
